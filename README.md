AI Powered Healthcare Assistant Chatbot

Project Overview

This project implements an AI-powered Healthcare Assistant chatbot using Natural Language Processing (NLP) and Hugging Face's Transformers library. The chatbot assists users by providing health-related advice based on common symptoms like fever, headache, cough, and more. It uses a pre-trained BERT-based model for answering healthcare-related questions and NLTK for preprocessing the input text.

The chatbot is deployed via a Streamlit web application, providing an interactive user interface for real-time health advice.

Technologies Used
Python
Streamlit (for the web-based user interface)
Hugging Face Transformers (for the question-answering model)
NLTK (for text preprocessing)
TensorFlow/PyTorch (depending on the backend model choice)
Features
Symptom-Based Advice: Provides healthcare advice based on common symptoms (fever, sore throat, headache, etc.).
Question Answering: Uses a BERT-based model to answer health-related questions.
Text Preprocessing: Uses NLTK to preprocess user input (tokenization and stopword removal) for better model performance.
Streamlit UI: Interactive web interface where users can input their symptoms or ask questions to the chatbot.
Real-Time Responses: Provides quick, personalized health recommendations and advice based on input.
Dataset and Model
The assistant does not require a specific dataset for training, as it relies on a pre-trained BERT-based question-answering model (deepset/bert-base-cased-squad2) from Hugging Face. However, it includes predefined rules to respond to common symptoms such as:

Fever
Headache
Sore Throat
Cough
Back Pain
Dizziness
And many othersâ€¦
Installation & Setup
1. Create a Virtual Environment
Create a virtual environment to isolate project dependencies:

bash
Copy
python -m venv env
Activate the environment:

Windows:
bash
Copy
env\Scripts\activate
Linux/Mac:
bash
Copy
source env/bin/activate
2. Install Dependencies
Install the required Python packages:

bash
Copy
pip install -r requirements.txt
The requirements.txt should include:

nginx
Copy
streamlit
transformers
nltk
tensorflow  # or torch, depending on your model backend
If you don't have requirements.txt:

bash
Copy
pip install streamlit transformers nltk tensorflow

or

pip install streamlit transformers nltk torch
3. Download NLTK Resources
Some NLTK resources are required for text processing (like stopwords and tokenizers). Download them by running this:

python
Copy
import nltk
nltk.download('punkt')
nltk.download('stopwords')
4. Run the Streamlit App
Start the application with:

bash
Copy
streamlit run healthcare_chatbot.py
This will open the chatbot in your web browser at http://localhost:8501.

Features

âœ” Symptom-Based Advice: Get suggestions for common symptoms like fever, cough, headache, and sore throat.

âœ” Question Answering: Use a pre-trained BERT-based model to get answers for specific healthcare-related queries.

âœ” Text Preprocessing: NLTK is used to clean and preprocess the user's input for better performance.

âœ” Interactive Streamlit Interface: Users can input their symptoms and receive immediate feedback through an interactive web interface.

âœ” Real-Time Prediction: Immediate health advice and personalized responses based on the user's input.

Model Architecture
The model is a simple combination of:

Text Preprocessing: The userâ€™s input text is tokenized and stopwords are removed using NLTK.
BERT-based Model: A pre-trained BERT model from Hugging Faceâ€™s transformers library is used for question answering. This model can comprehend complex health-related queries.
Symptom Matching: In case of common symptoms like fever, cough, or headache, predefined responses are provided.
Contextual Answering: If no predefined symptom matches, the model is used to provide answers from a context containing health-related scenarios.
Example Conversations
User: "I have a headache, what should I do?" Chatbot: "Frequent headaches may be caused by stress or dehydration. Please rest and drink water. Consult a doctor if it continues."

User: "I feel dizzy, should I be worried?" Chatbot: "Dizziness may indicate dehydration or low blood pressure. Rest and hydrate, and consult a doctor if it continues."

User: "I am sneezing a lot. What does it mean?" Chatbot: "Frequent sneezing may indicate allergies or a cold. Consult a doctor if symptoms persist."

Future Improvements

ðŸ”¹ Medical Appointment Scheduling: Integrate with a scheduling service to allow users to book appointments with healthcare providers directly from the chatbot.

ðŸ”¹ Expand Symptom Database: Add more symptoms and detailed responses for a wider range of healthcare issues.

ðŸ”¹ Add Multi-Language Support: Make the chatbot accessible in multiple languages.

ðŸ”¹ Use Advanced Models: Use more advanced or specialized models like GPT-3 for more detailed responses or multi-modal models for analyzing text and images.
